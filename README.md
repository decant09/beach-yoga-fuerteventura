### Design
#### Colour Scheme
The website colour palette was generated in a two steps, firtly by importing the hero image to [colormind](http://colormind.io). This then generated colours based on the image uploaded. I opted for the colour of #E2D6DC. This is a calming off-white pink colour which I chose as the background colour throughout.  
![](/docs/colour-palette/colormind-colour-palette.png)
Secondly, using this colour from colormind as a starting point, I used [ColorSpace](https://mycolor.space/?hex=%23E2D6DC&sub=1) to generate a classy palette.  
![](/docs/colour-palette/colorspace-colour-palette.png)  
From this colour palette I chose #54424B, which is grey/black colour, and used this as my font colour throughout.  
I kept the colour palette minimal in an effort to maintain harmony and serenity throughout the website.

#### Typography
I used [Figma](https://www.figma.com/google-fonts/josefin-sans-font-pairings/) for font pairing ideas.  
I chose Josefin slab for the main body font. It contains a little bit of style.   
I chose Lato, a cleaner font, for larger text to create a balanced contrast between the two.  

#### Imagery
The imagery chosen was dones so in an effort to tie in with the main palette of the hero image. Again this was done so to keep the experience of website flowing and relaxing. All imagery used is referenced in the credits in order of appearance as you progress through the website. The logo was generated using [Canva](https://www.canva.com/) and the colour palette used links in with the colour scheme of the website.  

### Wireframes
Wireframes were created for desktop as the website layout is the same across different device screen sizes. The one exception being the contact page, where the form and map areas are repositioned above and below each other on screens sizes of 800px and lower. A wireframe is provided to show this layout.

## Features
The website is made up of four pages. A home page, schedule page, contact page and a thank you page. The first three of these are accessible using the navigation bar. The fourth page is a thank you page which you land on when submit your contact form. The main structure of each page is a header, a body which contains information or a feature to access more information, and a footer.
- Header
    - Contained in the header is the Beach Yoga Fuertventura logo. This is also a link to the home page through out the website.
    - The navigation bar is located below the logo. Each element of the navigation bar is evenly spaced out in a horizontal or row-like fashion. This is maintained on all screen sizes. From here you can access each of the main three pages of the website.
    - This header layout is also maintained on the thank you page so you can easily navigate back to any of the three main pages from here.
![](/docs/byf-website-screenshots/header.png)  
- Footer
    - The footer contains social media links (Facebook, YouTube and Instagram) and an e-mail link.
    - The e-mail link, an envelope icon, takes you to an e-mail application, if there is one installed on your device. The application will open with the e-mail address "info@beachyogafuerteventura.com" in the recipient field and the word "Information" in the subject field.  
    - Universally recognisable icons for each media link and are given a clear space to occupy. This is maintained across device sizes.

- Home Page
    - Below the header on the home page is the hero image. This is lady in the reverse prayer yoga move facing the ocean. To the side of her is some text which states the name of the actiivty (Beach Yoga), where it is located (in El Cotillo, Fuerteventura), and a short statement about what this yoga group is for (Yoga for the mind, body and soul).  
    - This is followed by a yoga quote credited to Linda Sparrowe and below this an image of a lady in dancers pose yoga move on a beach which spans the width of the screen.
    - The "About Us" section describes what Beach Yoga Fuerteventura is and an image of a yoga class on a beach, with a teacher facing some students, follows this spans the width of the screen.

    - Below the header on the schedule page is an image of a beach with seven stones stacked on top of each other in a column. This is an image synonymous with yoga and represents the seven chakras of the body. Overlaying this image is the word "Schedule" making it clear that you are on the schedule page.

    - The form contains a first name text input, last name text , an e-mail address input and a text area to leave a message, followed by the newletter check-box and a submit button.
    - Adjacent to the form is a map with a pin drop location on it. As there is no exact physical location for Beach Yoga Fuerteventura, the pin drop on the map is provided to show a meeting point before class.
    - The form and map are located adjacent to each other but on smaller screen size a media query is used to allow each component to separate and occupy the width of the screen, form first, followed by map.

### Manual
- I used Google Dev Tools to test for screen responsiveness.  

- I tested on different browsers (chrome, firefox, safari & edge) to ensure the website preforms as expected across all of these.  

- I tested all the media links and hyperlinks on the website manually to ensure that they are all working as expexted. The media links redirect accordingly and the email link opens up as expected. The links in the main body of the website redirected appropraiately to the websites they are linked to and open in new tabs as intended.  

- I tested the form. It behaves as expected. The form can not be submitted until all fields are completed and there is an @ symbol in the e-mail field. If the submit button is clicked before completing the required fields a tooltip will highlight the field that needs attention. The newsletter check-box is ticked upon landing on the page and can be unticked if preferred. When all fields are completed and the submit button clicked you are re-directed to the thank you page as intended.

- I spellchecked the website by copying the text content to [Online Spellcheck](https://www.online-spellcheck.com/).

### Bugs
#### Known
- The whole header area is a hyperlink as opposed to just the logo area which is intended. If time permitted [stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40826300/how-to-place-an-image-in-a-header-surrounded-by-an-anchor-tag-and-make-the-image) is a useful possible solution.
- When viewed using safari on Apple iPhone 11 the timetable aligs to the right of the screen. It should appear as expected in the middle of the screen which it does on safari on an Apple iMac desktop. Unfortunately I was not able to resolve this bug.
#### Solved
- When the website was viewed using the link from the gitpod port the images on the website appeared as expected. However, when the website was viewed using the GitHub pages url the images did not appear at all. This was due to a leading "/" in image src path which when removed resolved the issue.
- The navigation bar was not lining up centrally. I noticed this as the schedule link was offset against the logo. Using dev tools I was able to see that there was some default marginm being applied at the start of the navigation bar which when removed resulted in the preferred alignment.
- The dancers pose image, the second image on the home page would strectch and become distorted as the screen size reduced. This was rescolved by applying object-position to cover.
- The text overlaying the hero image would begin to lay over the central figure hero image when the screen size reduced. This would have impacted it's clarity. This was resolved by enabling the hero image to move to the right using a background position rule in the media query and also by reducing the area that the text was allowed to occupy.
- At lower screen sizes the map and form did not behave as expected. They would display as block elements as intended however they did not cover the entire block and occupy the screen width. I realized that my media query rule was targeting the correct title to target, however I was targeting an id selector as opposed to a class selector. After identifying this and tidying up some margin rules the issues was resolved.

## Deployment
The site was deployed to GitHub pages and the following steps were followed to do so:

1. Login in to GitHub.
