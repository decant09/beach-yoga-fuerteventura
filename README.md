### Design
#### Colour Scheme
The website colour palette was generated in a two steps, firtly by importing the hero image to [colormind](http://colormind.io). This then generated colours based on the image uploaded. I opted for the colour of E2D6DC. This is a calming off-white pink colour which I chose as the background colour throughout.  
![](/docs/colour-palette/colormind-colour-palette.png)
Secondly, using this colour from colormind as a starting point, I used [ColorSpace](https://mycolor.space/?hex=%23E2D6DC&sub=1) to generate a classy palette.  
![](/docs/colour-palette/colorspace-colour-palette.png)  
From this colour palette I chose 54424B, which is grey/black colour, and used this as my font colour throughout.  
I kept the colour palette minimal in an effort to maintain harmony and serenity throughout the website.

#### Typography
I used [Figma](https://www.figma.com/google-fonts/josefin-sans-font-pairings/) for font pairing ideas.  
I chose Josefin slab for the main body font. It contains a little bit of style.   
I chose Lato, a cleaner font, for larger text to create a balanced contrast between the two.  

#### Imagery
The imagery chosen was dones so in an effort to tie in with the main palette of the hero image. Again this was done so to keep the experience of website flowing and relaxing. All imagery used is referenced in the credits in order of appearance as you progress through the website. The logo was generated using [Canva](https://www.canva.com/) and the colour palette used links in with the colour scheme of the website.  

### Wireframes

## Features
The website is made up of four pages. A home page, schedule page, contact page and a thank you page. The first three of these are accessible using the navigation bar. The fourth page is a thank you page which you land on when submit your contact form. The main structure of each page is a header, a body which contains information or a feature to access more information, and a footer.
- Header
    - Contained in the header is the Beach Yoga Fuertventura logo. This is also a link to the home page through out the website.
    - The navigation bar is located below the logo. Each element of the navigation bar is evenly spaced out in a horizontal or row-like fashion. This is maintained on all screen sizes. From here you can access each of the main three pages of the website.
    - This header layout is also maintained on the thank you page so you can easily navigate back to any of the three main pages from here.
![](/docs/byf-website-screenshots/header.png)  
- Footer
    - The footer contains social media links (Facebook, YouTube and Instagram) and an e-mail link.
    - The e-mail link, an envelope icon, takes you to an e-mail application, if there is one installed on your device. The application will open with the e-mail address "info@beachyogafuerteventura.com" in the recipient field and the word "Information" in the subject field.  
    - Universally recognisable icons for each media link and are given a clear space to occupy. This is maintained across device sizes.
![](docs/byf-website-screenshots/footer.png)  
- Home page
    - Below the header on the home page is the hero image. This is lady in the reverse prayer yoga move facing the ocean. To the side of her is some text which states the name of the actiivty (Beach Yoga), where it is located (in El Cotillo, Fuerteventura), and a short statement about what this yoga group is for (Yoga for the mind, body and soul).  
    - This is followed by a yoga quote credited to Linda Sparrowe and below this an image of a lady in dancers pose yoga move on a beach which spans the width of the screen.
    - The "About Us" section describes what Beach Yoga Fuerteventura is and an image of a yoga class on a beach, with a teacher facing some students, follows this spans the width of the screen. 
    - A why yoga section describes the benefits to doing yoga.
- Schedule page
    - Below the header on the schedule page is an image of a beach with seven stones stacked on top of each other in a column. This is an image synonymous with yoga and represents the seven chakras of the body. Overlaying this image is the word "Schedule" making it clear that you are on the schedule page.
    - A timetable shows the days, type of yoga and time of each yoga class.
    - A section below this describes what the different types of yoga are from the classes in the timetable.
- Contact page
    - Below the header on the contact page is an image of a beach, a building and some palm trees.  Overlaying this image are the words "Contact Us" making it clear that you are on the contact page.
    - A brief opener to the contact page is followed by a contact form with the option to sign up for a newsletter. This option is automatically ticked when the page loads and can be unticked if required by the user.
    - The form contains a first name text input, last name text , an e-mail address input and a text area to leave a message, followed by the newletter check-box and a submit button.
    - Adjacent to the form is a map with a pin drop location on it. As there is no exact physical location for Beach Yoga Fuerteventura, the pin drop on the map is provided to show a meeting point before class.
    - The form and map are located adjacent to each other but on smaller screen size a media query is used to allow each component to separate and occupy the width of the screen, form first, followed by map.

### Bugs
#### Known
The whole header area is a hyperlink as opposed to just the logo area which is intended. If time permitted [stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40826300/how-to-place-an-image-in-a-header-surrounded-by-an-anchor-tag-and-make-the-image) is a useful possible solution.
