            <h2>Why Yoga?</h2>
            <p>

                wondering what are the benefits of yoga? There are many wonderful benefits to practicing yoga, some of which are
                outlined here by
                <a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/9-benefits-of-yoga" target="_blank">

            <h3>Yoga improves strength, balance and flexibility.</h3>
            <p>
                Slow movements and deep breathing increase blood flow and warm up muscles, while holding a pose can build strength.
            </p>

            <h3>Yoga helps with back pain relief.</h3>
            <p>
                Yoga is as good as basic stretching for easing pain and improving mobility in people with lower back pain.
                The American College of Physicians recommends yoga as a first-line treatment for chronic low back pain.

            <h3>Yoga can ease arthritis symptoms.</h3>
            <p>
                Gentle yoga has been shown to ease some of the discomfort of tender, swollen joints for people with arthritis,
                according to a Johns Hopkins review of 11 recent studies.

        <div>
            <h3>Yoga benefits heart health.</h3>
            <p>
                Regular yoga practice may reduce levels of stress and body-wide inflammation, contributing to healthier hearts.
                Several of the factors contributing to heart disease, including high blood pressure and excess weight, can also
                be addressed through yoga.

            <h3>Yoga relaxes you, to help you sleep better.</h3>
            <p>
                Research shows that a consistent bedtime yoga routine can help you get in the right mindset and prepare your body
                to fall asleep and stay asleep.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Yoga can mean more energy and brighter moods.</h3>
            <p>
                You may feel increased mental and physical energy, a boost in alertness and enthusiasm, and fewer negative feelings
                after getting into a routine of practicing yoga.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Yoga helps you manage stress.</h3>
            <p>
                According to the National Institutes of Health, scientific evidence shows that yoga supports stress management,
                mental health, mindfulness, healthy eating, weight loss and quality sleep.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Yoga connects you with a supportive community.</h3>
            <p>
                Participating in yoga classes can ease loneliness and provide an environment for group healing and support.
                Even during one-on-one sessions loneliness is reduced as one is acknowledged as a unique individual, being
                listened to and participating in the creation of a personalized yoga plan.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Yoga promotes better self-care.</h3>
            <p>
                Incorporating yoga into your routine and making it a habit helps improve overall self-care practices.
