            <p>
                We are a yoga club based in El Cotillo, Fuerteventura. Our aim is to take you to a place where you can
                re-connect with nature, become grounded and tap into the special energy of this magical island. Our classes
                are held on the beach at sunrise, sunset and each month, in the late evening under a beautiful full moon.
            </p>
            <p>
                We have been practicing yoga in this way for many years and we would love for you to join us, be present and free
                your mind. We are a yoga club for all levels and no prior yoga experience is required.
            </p>
                We look forward to seeing you,
            <p>
                Namaste
