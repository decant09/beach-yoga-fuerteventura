                        There are many wonderful

                    <p>
                        Yoga improves strength, balance and flexibility. It can ease pain and improve mobility in people with lower
                        back pain. For those suffering with arthritis, gentle yoga has been shown to ease some of the discomfort
                        associated.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="benefits">Cardiovascular</h3>
                    <p>
                        Regular yoga practice may reduce levels of stress and body-wide inflammation, contributing to healthier hearts.
                        Several of the factors contributing to heart disease, including high blood pressure and excess weight, can also
                        be addressed through yoga.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="benefits">Mental</h3>
                    <p>
                        Yoga relaxes you and can help you manage stress, have brighter moods and give you more energy. A bedtime yoga
                        routine can help you get in the right mindset and prepare your body to fall asleep and stay asleep longer.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="benefits">Social</h3>
                    <p>
                        Participating in yoga classes can ease loneliness and provide an environment for group healing and support.
                        Even during one-on-one sessions loneliness is reduced as one is acknowledged as a unique individual, being
                        listened to and participating in the creation of a personalized yoga plan.
